# Deep Reinforcement Learning Course
This repository contains my notes and public implementation of assignments from the Deep Reinforcement Learning course offered by [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction?fw=pt)ðŸ¤— . The course covers the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and more advanced topics such as descision transformers, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), and language models in RL.
