# Deep Reinforcement Learning Course
This repository contains my notes and complete implementation of assignments and projects from the Deep Reinforcement Learning course offered by [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction?fw=pt)ðŸ¤— . The course covers the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and more advanced topics such as descision transformers, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), and language models in RL.

Table of contents
notes: Contains my notes on the various concepts and algorithms covered in the course.
assignments: Contains my implementation of the course's assignments, including detailed explanations of my thought process and the code.
projects: Contains my implementation of the course's final projects, including detailed explanations of my thought process and the code.
Prerequisites
The assignments and projects in this repository use Hugging Face's open-source libraries and are implemented in Python. To run the code, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
